# phwd: The historical weather data library for python
PHWD is short for Python Historical Weather Data.
This library is a easy to use library to get historical weather data from NOAA NECI without the compications of directly getting data.

Also just a quick thing: This is currently in like **very** early devlopment so i dont recommend to use this for any large project
